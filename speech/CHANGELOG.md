### Breaking Changes

- The deprecated Speech layer (deprecated since 0.27.0) has been removed. If you are still using  it, the [migration guide](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/python-client-migration) is still available.
- The following changes are _technically_ breaking but very unlikely to affect you directly:
  * `google.cloud.gapic.speech.v1` moved to `google.cloud.speech_v1.gapic`, in accordance with more recent clients.
  * `google.cloud.proto.speech.v1` moved to `google.cloud.speech_v1.proto`, in accordance with more recent clients.

### Dependencies

  * Removed dependency on `google-gax`.
  * Added dependency on `google-api-core`, its replacement.

## 0.30.0

- Added link to "Python Development Environment Setup Guide" in
  project README (#4187, h/t to @michaelawyu)

  `googleapis-common-protos`dependencies (#4096, #4098)
